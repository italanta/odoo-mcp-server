# Setup

This is the setup guide for the MCP 2.0 deployment model. The preferred organisation path is a **reachable OpenCrane remote MCP connector** for Claude Cowork. Local stdio remains a fully supported, local-first path and does not require a hosted relay.

## Choose a path

| Path | Use it when | Credential boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Cowork through OpenCrane (primary) | Your organisation needs a managed Cowork connector | OpenCrane OAuth identifies the user; the user's Odoo credential is held and selected only for that exact user/profile. |
| Local stdio (secondary) | You want a personal or offline-friendly setup | The MCP process runs on the user's machine; onboarding uses a loopback or CLI flow, not the model conversation. |

A plugin repository is **not** a remote MCP host. Importing a plugin into Cowork can distribute instructions or configuration, but it does not make this repository reachable from Cowork and must not be represented as remote hosting.

## 1. Claude Cowork through OpenCrane (primary)

### Organisation onboarding

An OpenCrane administrator must first provide a reachable remote MCP endpoint and configure it as the Cowork connector. The connector must:

1. Require per-user OAuth; do not use a shared service identity for users' Odoo access.
2. Resolve a user identity before selecting an Odoo profile or releasing any credential.
3. Keep raw Odoo API keys behind the per-user credential provider; the MCP runtime receives only the credential lease needed for the selected profile.
4. Enforce the existing write approval policy server-side. Cowork sandboxing does not make arbitrary files, prompts, or credentials safe.
5. Restrict network access and audit connector/profile selection according to your organisation's OpenCrane policy.

The current repository does **not** ship a live-qualified OpenCrane adapter or managed remote endpoint. Until those adapters and live qualification are wired, connector setup must fail closed rather than silently falling back to a shared or local credential.

### Cowork connector configuration

After the organisation has deployed and qualified its endpoint, add that endpoint in the Claude Cowork admin connector flow. Use the OpenCrane-issued OAuth configuration for your environment; do not point Cowork at this Git repository or rely on a plugin import as a substitute.

Validate with a non-production Odoo profile first:

1. Sign in to Cowork and complete OpenCrane OAuth.
2. Open the Odoo MCP connector and confirm that it identifies the signed-in user.
3. Complete first-use Odoo onboarding below.
4. Run `odoo_runtime_info` and then `odoo_ping`.
5. Keep writes disabled until the staged write flow is approved in your environment.

### First use: create an Odoo profile

For each user, onboarding collects an Odoo URL, database, login email, Odoo version/transport, and API key through the organisation's secure credential flow. The API key must never be pasted into chat, tool arguments, prompts, or a plugin configuration file.

The profile is bound to the authenticated user and an explicit profile identifier. The server must reject an absent, ambiguous, revoked, or cross-user profile selection. A successful onboarding validates the credential with Odoo before it is activated.

### Day two: profiles, rotation, and revocation

- Create separate profiles for separate databases, companies, or Odoo identities; choose one explicitly for each session or request.
- Rotate an Odoo API key by updating the selected profile through the secure credential flow, then revalidate it before activation.
- Revoke access by disabling the OpenCrane connector entitlement and revoking/deleting the affected profile credential. Existing leases must expire quickly and be rechecked before external Odoo I/O.
- Removing a user from the organisation must prevent new profile selection and credential release. Review audit records and rotate any Odoo key where policy requires it.

## 2. Local stdio (secondary, local-first)

Local stdio runs the server on the user's device. It does not require OpenCrane, a hosted relay, or a central shared Odoo-token store.

### Install

macOS or Linux:

```bash
uv tool install odoo-mcp-server
odoo-mcp-server
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
uv tool install odoo-mcp-server
odoo-mcp-server
```

For a source checkout instead:

```bash
uv run odoo-mcp-server
```

Add the generated client snippet from `dist/client-configs/` to your local MCP client configuration. The available snippets are generated artifacts; regenerate them whenever the manifest or configuration generator changes.

### Local credential onboarding

Run the terminal fallback in the same operating-system user account as the MCP server:

```bash
odoo-mcp-onboard
```

On Windows PowerShell, the command is the same after `uv tool install`. Normal profile metadata is entered as terminal text; the API key is read with hidden `getpass` input, authenticated, and only then written to the existing owner-only legacy credentials file. This file adapter is transitional while OS credential-store support is implemented.

The MCP `odoo_setup_credentials` tool itself never accepts the API key. The loopback and hosted onboarding adapters are not yet wired, so that tool reports unavailable in the current local composition; do not fall back to collecting an API key through the MCP conversation.

### Select the Odoo transport

- Odoo 18 and below: `xmlrpc`
- Odoo 19 and above: `json2`

`json2` requires an Odoo API key and has its own supported-method boundaries. Select the transport as part of the profile; do not rely on a global transport setting when multiple profiles are in use.

### Verify safely

1. Confirm the selected profile and transport with `odoo_runtime_info`.
2. Run `odoo_ping` against a non-production database where possible.
3. Exercise read-only tools before considering write access.
4. Enable writes only through the explicit, staged approval policy; a client UI or sandbox is not an approval boundary on its own.

## Plugin repositories

You may fork this repository to review or distribute plugin metadata, but the repository remains source and packaging material. It is not a network service, OAuth issuer, credential vault, or remote connector. Pair it with a separately deployed and qualified OpenCrane remote connector for Cowork, or use the local stdio path.

## Updates and troubleshooting

- Prefer versioned release assets over the rolling `latest-main` prerelease for regular users.
- After a local update, restart the local MCP client so it loads the new process.
- If `odoo_ping` fails, verify the selected profile's URL, database, login email, API-key status, and transport version rule.
- If remote Cowork setup is unavailable, ask the OpenCrane administrator to qualify the connector; do not substitute a shared API key or a repository import.

## Security reminder

- Never put raw Odoo API keys in conversations, prompts, plugin manifests, or shared configuration files.
- Keep profiles, OAuth identity, and credential release bound to one user at a time.
- A missing adapter, entitlement, profile, or live qualification is an unavailable state, not permission to bypass the boundary.
