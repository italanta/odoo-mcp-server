"""
Outbound Communication Safety Guard.

NON-NEGOTIABLE: AI must never trigger outbound communication from Odoo.
This module enforces that rule at the code level — the first of three layers
(code block → human approval → Odoo permissions).

See Architecture Document Section 5.4 for full specification.
